            <h2>Step 1: Establish a Routine</h2>           
            <p>Offer meals and snacks at the same time each day to establish a pattern and avoid all-day grazing. This helps your toddler develop healthy eating habits and reduces the likelihood of power struggles. Stick to scheduled feedings and sort out whether your child is hungry or sad, full or tired.</p>

            <h2>Step 2: Use Cups and Encourage Self-Feeding</h2>           
            <p>By 12 months, transition from bottles to cups, and use cups with straws instead of sippy cups. Teach your toddler to feed themselves with a spoon and fork, allowing them to develop important fine motor skills and independence. This step-by-step approach helps your child learn to eat and makes mealtime more enjoyable.</p>

            <h2>Step 3: Offer a Variety of Nutritious Foods</h2>            
            <p>Provide a balanced diet with a variety of foods, including protein sources, vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. Serve small portions (about 1/4 to 1/2 of an adult serving size) and let your toddler decide how much they want to eat. This approach helps them develop healthy eating habits and reduces the risk of overfeeding or underfeeding. Remember to follow the American Academy of Pediatrics’ guidelines for calorie intake based on your child’s height and age.</p>
